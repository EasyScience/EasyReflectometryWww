  title: Making _reflectometry_ data analysis and modelling _easy_
  description: >-
    An intuitive and user-friendly application which integrates multiple popular
    reflectometry data analysis libraries such as
    [refnx](https://refnx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and
    [refl1d](https://refl1d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Allowing for the
    simulation of reflectometry profiles based on layered structures and
    refinement against experimental data.
